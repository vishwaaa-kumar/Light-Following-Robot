# Light-Following-Robot

  With the rise of technology, we need to cope with science. The objective of this project is to demonstrate how we can operate a locomotive device using gestures.

  We will use an Adurino board which connects our different hardware components with it. The Adurino board is fed with specific machine code which controls the hardware components. The machine code will have all the cases to be done by the model  with respect to the given input. So, the final model will have the correct locomotion as desired by the programmer.
